## User Experience (UX)
The purpose of this website is to create a functioning site that provides a business with a link to their customers, both current and potential. Their customers will need to see the classes they have on offer as well as the people running these classes. Potential customers need a way of contacting these business owners and to see what functionality they have on offer.  
  
The location of Cardiff was used as I have an intimate knowledge of the area. I am a member of a gym and used this knowledge to bulk the idea of a newer gym which is family run.

- Design
    - Colour Scheme
        - There are two main colours used in the site, grey and navy blue. Shades of these are used to match a more masculine approach, and are strong, matching the aesthetic of the gym environment.
    - Typography
        - The Ariel and Helvetica font is the main font used throughout the whole website with Sans Serif as the fallback font in case for any reason the font isn't being imported into the site correctly. Both Ariel and Helvetica are easy to read and visually pleasing. The font spacing has been chosen so people of different reading and education levels can understand the page, as directed by a code for dyslexia page.
    - Imagery
        - The images used evoke a sense of strength and power. By using images of people working out, it entices users to engage with the site and with the business. The large hero image at the top of the page shows an open space which is welcoming and appropriate regarding covid-related issues.

### Testing User Stories from User Experience Section
 
- First Time Visitor Goals
    - As a first time visitor, I want to easily navigate around the website
        - Upon entering the site, users are greeted with a menu banner that on larger screens takes up the entire width of the page. On smaller screens, this reduces in size. The menu is easy to navigate through and easy to understand. 
        - Users have 3 options other than the home page to navigate through.
    - As a first time visitor, I want to find the information that interests me quickly
        - The menu is large and easy to see, due to the colour scheme. White text shows on the navy blue bachground of the buttons, making these links stand out.
    - As a first time visitor, I want to see the contact details for the site easily
        - Users are able to select the 'contact' section from every page, and can use the footer to access more contact details.
- Returning Visitor Goals
    - As a returning visitor, I want to find updated class details quickly
        - Returning users can navigate to the 'classes' page within 1 click.
    - As a returning visitor, I want to see what items are available to buy
        - Returning users can navigate to the 'shop' page within 1 click.
    - As a returning visitor, I want to find out more about upgrading my membership
        - Returning users can navigate to the 'shop' page within 1 click.
- Frequent User Goals
    - As a frequent user, I want to be able to access my gyms social media quickly
        - Frequent users are able to see large social media buttons on every page in the site, which take users to the social media selection. These links lead to the social media homepage. 
    - As a frequest user, I want to see people as determined as me in their fitness journey
        - Frequent users can see the owners, who they will recognise as frequenting the gym. The images used show people exercising and working out, pushing their limits. 

### Further Testing
- The Website was tested on a variety of browsers, including Google Chrome, Internet Explorer, Microsoft Edge and Safari browsers.
- The website was viewed on a variety of devices such as Windows Laptop, iPhone 12, Samsung Galaxy and Google Pixel. These were tested on the phones own internal browsers as well as Google Chrome and Google Chrome Beta.
- A large amount of testing was done to ensure that all pages were linking correctly. Some links were found to be broken, due to renaming of the .html sites.
- Friends and family members were asked to review the site and documentation to point out any bugs and/or user experience issues.

#### Known Bugs
- When viewed on smaller screens, the gym_image overlay text is too large for the screen to display properly. This has been scaled down as small as possible, however it cannot be scaled smaller as it would cause detriment to users with larger screens. The users this affect are users on screen smaller than 400px wide, which is a small number of users.
